                <p class="bio">
                    I'm a <strong>.NET Developer</strong> with <strong>3+ years</strong> of experience building
                    scalable, secure web applications.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    Expert in <strong>.NET Core</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>MS SQL Server</strong>, I
                    deliver reliable backends and smooth frontend experiences.
                    I turn complex requirements into practical solutions that drive business value.
                    Beyond coding, I focus heavily on clean architecture, performance optimization, and long-term system
                    maintainability.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    I enjoy solving tough technical challenges and transforming ideas into polished, production-ready
                    features.
                    My workflow is built around clear communication, attention to detail, and consistent delivery.
                    Whether it’s improving an existing system or developing a platform from scratch, I bring a
                    problem-solver mindset and a commitment to quality in every project.
